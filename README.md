# Titanic Kaggle Challenge - Data Science Project README

## Overview

This README provides an overview of my solution to the Titanic Kaggle Challenge using decision trees, data preprocessing techniques, and one-hot encoding. The challenge involves predicting survival on the Titanic based on passenger data.

## Project Structure

The Titanic Kaggle Challenge project is structured as follows:

1. **Data Exploration**: Analyzing and visualizing the dataset to understand relationships between features and survival outcomes.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and preparing features for modeling.

3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features and transforming existing ones to improve model performance.

4. **Modeling with Decision Trees**: Training decision tree classifiers on the preprocessed data to predict survival.

5. **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using accuracy and other relevant metrics.

## Approach

### Data Exploration

- **Dataset**: Includes features like passenger class, age, sex, fare, cabin, and survival status.
- **Visualization**: Utilized histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices to explore relationships between features and survival.

### Data Preprocessing

- **Handling Missing Values**: Imputed missing values in age and embarked port columns based on median and mode values, respectively.
- **Feature Selection**: Selected relevant features for modeling, such as passenger class, age, sex, and fare.
- **One-Hot Encoding**: Transformed categorical variables (e.g., sex, embarked port) into numerical form using one-hot encoding to prepare them for the decision tree model.

### Feature Engineering

- **Creating New Features**: Extracted titles from passenger names and calculated family size from siblings/spouse and parents/children features.
- **Normalization**: Scaled numerical features like age and fare to ensure consistency in model training.

### Modeling with Decision Trees

- **Decision Tree Classifier**: Implemented decision tree classifiers using scikit-learn.
- **Parameter Tuning**: Optimized decision tree hyperparameters such as maximum depth and minimum samples split using grid search to improve model performance.

### Evaluation Metrics

- **Accuracy**: Measure of correct predictions overall.

## Getting Started

To replicate or explore this project:

1. **Dataset**: Download the Titanic dataset from Kaggle or use the provided CSV files.
2. **Environment Setup**: Set up a Python environment with pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib/seaborn for visualization.
3. **Notebook Execution**: Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script sequentially to observe data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation steps.
